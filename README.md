In this Mario game, the program starts by loading custom sprites and creating animations. It then handles character movements, detects collisions, and includes a jumping mechanic to bring the classic Mario experience to life. Although developed using Python, the game leverages HTML-like output for display, combining the flexibility of Python scripting with the visual capabilities of web technologies.
